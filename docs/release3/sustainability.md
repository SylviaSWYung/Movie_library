# Sustainability 

The Movie Library application contributes to sustainability by providing social, economic, personal, and technical benefits throughout its development and use.

Socially, it strengthens community by encouraging users to visit the library, interact with librarians, and participate in shared places. This forms a sense of connection often lacking in other digital services. Users engage in face-to-face conversations with librarians when renting movies, which can contribute to a stronger sense of community involvement and familiarity. 

Economically, the service offers free access to movies, making entertainment accessible without the need for the users to buy or rent DVDs or subscribe to paid services. Environmentally, this reduces the demand for physical DVDs by offering digital streaming or rentals, lowering production and waste.

On an individual level, the service provides an accessible escape from daily routines, which can be valuable tool for mental health. Watching movies can offer a welcome respite, allowing users to unwind and relax, which is particularly beneficial for those seeking relief from stress and the demands in their everyday life. 

Technically, the app is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, making it accessible to people of all ages and abilities. Clear interfaces and intuitive navigation ensure that even individuals unfamiliar with digital technology can use the service with minimal guidance. 

Deploying and maintaining the service involves regular updates to ensure smooth operation and keep the library’s collection current. Librarians can easily update the movie catalog through built-in functions that adds and removes movies, ensuring the service remains relevant to users. Additionally, updates to the app’s interface or functions could be implemented to accommodate users with specific needs, such as those with visual impairment or learning disabilities. For example, larger fonts, high-contrast displays, or even auditory assistance could make the service more accessible. 

In the future, a self-service model could provide more accessibility, allowing users to engage directly with the app on a desk or terminal in the library. Users could use the app to search for movies, track their rentals, and save films of interest to a personal account with secure login credentials. These accounts would allow users to manage their movie lists independently, without needing to interact with the librarian unless necessary. Librarians would retain access to essential administrative functions, such as adding or deleting movies, to maintain control over the library’s collection and ensure quality. 

The main target group of this product is librarians, given their essential role in maintaining the library’s movie offerings. However, it simultaneously empowers users to use a library resource independently, fostering digital literacy in a community-centered environment. This approach ensures the service remains sustainable and valuable by emphasizing social engagement, economic accessibility, individual mental health benefits, and ease of use, providing a well-rounded, sustainable service for both librarians and users.
