# Challenges 

## Challenge 1: 
Throughout the project, we encountered issues with Eclipse Che, as it did not function properly between release 1 and release 2. After release 2, the issue was resolved, and we were able to run our project through Eclipse Che. We discovered that, during the period between release 1 and release 2, the tests did not run as expected, primarily because they needed to be headless, a requirement we were unaware of since Eclipse Che was not accessible. When the issue got fixed from the course staff. It took us approximately one week to configure all the tests from release 2 to be headless. This experience taught us about how Eclipse Che operates as a new IDE that we have never used before, and highlighted the need for re-writing the tests we learned in previous courses to adapt to the new IDE environment.  

## Challenge 2: 
Another challenge we encountered was that our application appeared differently in Eclipse Che than in VSCode. Specifically, the choice box on the front page of the application cut the last movie title in half. After discussing the issue with the technical assistant and attending a Q&A session, it became clear that the solution was uncertain. We attempted several adjustments, including changing the scale, switching to different types of boxes, and repositioning the "more info" button to determine if it was causing the issue. We have tried every solution possible, and unfortunately couldn't resolve the issue. However, through this challenge, we learned a great deal about modifying application frontends and how seemingly small design changes can have unexpected consequences across different environments.
