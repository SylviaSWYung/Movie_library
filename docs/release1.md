# Release 1 documentation 

## Milestones Reached 
In this first release, we have created all necassary java classes; movie.java, moviemanager.java, fxml documents, controllers, maven and eclipse. The goal for this release was to complete basic infrastructure, such that the later development would be much smoother and easier. <br>
- Need to write, test for movie.java and moviemanager.java

## User Story 
The user story we wanted to fulfill is to allow the user to lend a movie from the library. (This task was completed succesfully). Even though the user story was fulfilles there are some aspects og it we intend on changing later on:
* The "I want it!" button is currently always clickable. We want to implement a feature that disables this button if the movie has already been lent to another user.
* 

## Experiences 
Our plan was to meet two times in a week, and potensially have more meeting if needed. For this release, we met four times to work with this project. If needed we would communicate efficiently through the app Messenger, so that the work progress would be smoother. If someone had less workload, they would annonce it so that they would get more task to do. We also learned that being active in git was essensital for team work, when a merge request is active, one member that is available would reveiw it. An active merge request would be announced in the Messenger group. This reduce the stack of merge request, so it wont be overwhelming.
