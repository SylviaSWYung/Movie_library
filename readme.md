# Movie Library 

## Overview 
Our app is called Movie Library. The Frontpage is designed to provide an overview of all available movies for lending, presented in a down scrollable list. Users can select a movie theyâ€™re interested in and click the "More Info" button, which takes them to the Moviepage. The Moviepage offers detailed information about the selected film, including a brief summary. At the bottom of the page, there are two buttons: "I want it!" and "Cancel." By clicking "I want it!", the movie will be lent to the user. Clicking "Cancel" will return the user to the Frontpage.
